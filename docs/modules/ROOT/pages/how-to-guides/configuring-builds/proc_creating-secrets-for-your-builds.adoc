= Creating secrets for your builds 

When you building your pipelines, you might want to add tasks that require *secrets* in order to access external resources.

NOTE: One such task is the link:https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/tree/main/task/sast-snyk-check[sast-snyk-check] task that that uses the third-party service link:https://snyk.io/[snyk] to perform static application security testing (SAST) as a part of the default {ProductName} pipeline. Use this procedure to upload your snyk.io token. Name the secret `sast_snyk_task` so that the snyk task in the {ProductName} pipeline will recognize it and use it.

. From the **Secrets** page, click **Add secret**.
